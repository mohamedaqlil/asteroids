## Introduction

Asteroids is a timeless arcade game where players navigate a spaceship through a field of asteroids while aiming to destroy them and avoid collisions. This project will guide you through creating a version of this game using Pygame, emphasizing both game mechanics and coding principles.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)

To install Pygame, you can run:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/mohamedaqlil/asteroids-game.git>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <asteroids-game>
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies mentioned above.

## Game Features

- Player controls for movement and shooting
- Asteroids that spawn randomly and can be avoided
- Basic game loop structure to handle updates and rendering
- Object-oriented programming design for cleaner code and better management of game objects

## Chapter Overview

### Chapter 1: Pygame
- Set up the project and install Pygame.
- Understand the Pygame environment and initialize the game window.

### Chapter 2: Player
- Create a `Player` class to manage the player's ship.
- Implement movement and user input handling for the player.

### Chapter 3: Asteroids
- Add an `Asteroid` class to introduce obstacles in the game.
- Implement collision detection between the player and asteroids.

## Usage

To start the game, run the following command from the project directory:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Make sure to customize any settings you want in the source code, such as player speed and asteroid count, before running the game.
